# SPOT-Contact-Single

Introduction
----
Accurate prediction of protein contact-map is essential for accurate protein structure and function prediction. As a result, many methods have been developed for protein contact map prediction. However, most methods rely on protein-sequence-evolutionary information, which may not exist for many proteins due to lack of naturally occurring homologous sequences. Moreover, generating evolutionary profiles is computationally intensive. Here, we developed a contact-map predictor utilizing the output of a pre-trained language model ESM-1B as an input along with a large training set and an ensemble of residual neural networks.


Results
----
We showed that the proposed method makes a significant improvement over a single-sequence-based predictor SSCpred with 15% improvement in the F1-score for the independent CASP14-FM test set. It also outperforms evolutionary-profile-based methods TrRosetta and SPOT-Contact with 48.7% and 48.5% respective improvement in the F1-score on the proteins without homologs (Neff=1) in the independent SPOT-2018 set. The new method provides a much faster and reasonably accurate alternative to evolution-based methods, useful for large-scale prediction.
